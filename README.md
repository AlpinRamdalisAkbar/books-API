# books-API
API project that i made for practice using Go this project made with mux and mysql, so you must do some of this things first :
<ul>
 <li>✔ go get github.com/gorilla/mux</li>
 <li>✔ go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql</li>
</ul

After that you can run the code using <p>go run main.go</p> 
or 
<p>go build main.go && ./main</p>
